### 🌟Hello there! 

As a documentation engineer in the telecommunications field, I've honed my skills in technical documentation and translation over 6 years, seamlessly merging Eastern and Western thought. Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a love for exploration, I find joy in crafting words to uncover and share knowledge.📚
 💡

### 😄 Personal Interests 

I like literature, particularly Maugham's words. He once said, "In youth the years stretch before one so long that it is hard to realize that they will past." As someone deeply in tune with emotions, mine and others, I'm drawn to capturing life's fleeting moments through writing. 🌱

### 🖋️ Writing 

Marguerite said, "Expressing yourself is like shouting in a field. Instead, why not evoke curiosity and interest in your readers?" Inspired by this, I want stir curiosity and interest through my words, beyond just self-expression. ✨
