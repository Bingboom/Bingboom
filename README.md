### 🌟Hello there! 

I'm an INFP working in telecommunications as a technical documentation engineer and translator. With 6 years in the game, I've sharpened my tech writing skills and blended Eastern and Western thinking styles. Curious and always up for discovery, I love weaving words to explore and share knowledge. 🌍📚

### 💼 Professional Experience 

In communications, my 6-year journey has honed my technical writing, merging Eastern and Western perspectives, and boosted my self-learning skills. 💡

### 📚 Personal Interests 

I'm an avid reader, particularly fond of Maugham's words. He once said, "In youth, the days seem endless, yet they eventually become past." As an emotionally attuned person, I often reflect on my feelings and those around me. This emotional depth fuels my desire to capture life's moments in writing. 🌱

### 🖋️ Philosophy on Writing and Communication 

Marguerite said, "Expressing yourself is like shouting in a field. Instead, why not evoke curiosity and interest in your readers?" Inspired by this, I aim to stir curiosity and interest through my words, beyond just self-expression. ✨
